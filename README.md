# Test Repo - 4ZP6A/B
Simple unity VR-ready (hopefully) scene. 

## Instructions:

1. Update to latest version of **Unity**:  https://unity3d.com/get-unity/update
2. Once repo set up locally, download **git LFS** (https://git-lfs.github.com/) and run this in your local repository:  *git install lfs*
3. Download **Steam** and **SteamVR** *(under Library->Tools in Steam)*:  https://store.steampowered.com/about/
4. Launch Unity project and **'Accept All'** SteamVR Unity settings suggestions. 

For actual usage, you need to have SteamVR hooked up properly with Vive for everything to work together.
